    <p>Hello! My name is Bryan Liang and this is my homework page for CNIT132 at City College of San Francisco.
        I am
        an aspiring web/software developer and I am currently taking computer science courses at CCSF. I
        graduated
        from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's degree in Physics. I also completed UC Berkeley Extension's Full
        Stack
        Web Development Boot Camp. At CCSF, I completed the Java Certificate of Achievement and I am currently
        working towards completing the Web Application Programming certificate.</p>
    <p>The reason my interests changed from Physics to Computer Science was because I took a project based class
        during my senior year of college. This class required programming an Arduino to read input from sensors
        and
        react to the input. This was the best class I ever took and it was my first exposure to programming. I
        completed my degree and decided to teach myself how to code. That eventually lead me to the Berkeley
        boot
        camp and classes at CCSF. While learning how to code, there were a few websites that helped
        tremendously. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/</a> is one
        of these sites.
        W3schools
        provides documentation and an example of how something would work. The "try it yourself" is the best
        part of
        the website.</p>
    <p>I currently work as a math tutor, teaching students from elementary school to high school. I mainly teach
        students studying for the SAT, but I also help them with their school homework.</p>
    <p>When I am not coding or working, you can find me at the bowling alley or on my computer playing video
        games.
        I am an avid bowler, bowling at least once a week at Classic Bowling in Daly City. My average is not
        that
        high, at 150, but I am slowly improving. As mentioned, my other hobby is gaming. I am a PC gamer and I
        play
        every genre of video game.</p>
    <p>City College of San Francisco has student counseling that helped me decide what courses would best help
        me.
        Their website can be found at <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#leftnav"
            target="_blank">CCSF
            Student
            Counceling</a>. You can do walk-ins, but I suggest picking a time that is not the beginning of the
        semester or you will wait a long time. The main office is in Conlan Hall, but I know they have
        counseling in
        MUB as well. Check out the site for more information.</p>

    <h2>Good Links</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>
            <p>Codecademy is one of the first sites I visited when teaching myself how to code. They have a lot of
                intuitive tutorials that guide beginners really well.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>
            <p>Github is a great website where you can host websites for free. You can also push up your code into a
                repository for other developers to see.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">Geeks for geeks</a>
            <p>Geeks for geeks is another
                great website to find tutorials on various programming languages. I find my self on this website a
                lot
                after doing a google search on any question I have regarding Java.</p>
