          Hello! My name is Bryan Liang and this is my homework page for CNIT132
          at City College of San Francisco. I am an aspiring web/software
          developer and I am currently taking computer science courses at CCSF.
          I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's degree in Physics. I
          also completed UC Berkeley Extension's Full Stack Web Development Boot
          Camp. At CCSF, I completed the Java Certificate of Achievement and I
          am currently working towards completing the Web Application
          Programming certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason my interests changed from Physics to Computer Science was
          because I took a project based class during my senior year of college.
          This class required programming an Arduino to read input from sensors
          and react to the input. This was the best class I ever took and it was
          my first exposure to programming. I completed my degree and decided to
          teach myself how to code. That eventually lead me to the Berkeley boot
          camp and classes at CCSF. While learning how to code, there were a few
          websites that helped tremendously.
          <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >W3Schools</a
          >
          is one of these sites. W3schools provides documentation and an example
          of how something would work. The "try it yourself" is the best part of
          the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a math tutor, teaching students from elementary
          school to high school. I mainly teach students studying for the SAT,
          but I also help them with their school homework.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not coding or working, you can find me at the bowling alley
          or on my computer playing video games. I am an avid bowler, bowling at
          least once a week at Classic Bowling in Daly City. My average is not
          that high, at 150, but I am slowly improving. As mentioned, my other
          hobby is gaming. I am a PC gamer and I play every genre of video game.
        </p>
        <p>
          City College of San Francisco has student counseling that helped me
          decide what courses would best help me. Their website can be found at

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >CCSF Student Counceling</a
          >. You can do walk-ins, but I suggest picking a time that is not the
          beginning of the semester or you will wait a long time. The main
          office is in Conlan Hall, but I know they have counseling in MUB as
          well. Check out the site for more information.

              Codecademy is one of the first sites I visited when teaching
              myself how to code. They have a lot of intuitive tutorials that
              guide beginners really well.

            <p>
              Github is a great website where you can host websites for free.
              You can also push up your code into a repository for other
              developers to see.

            <p>
              Geeks for geeks is another great website to find tutorials on
              various programming languages. I find myself on this website a lot
              after doing a google search on any question I have regarding Java.
