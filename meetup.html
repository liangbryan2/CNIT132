              This was supposed to be my MeetUp experience page. Due to
              COVID-19, that is no longer possible. This will now be a page
              dedicated to some of the resources I have used while creating this
              website.

              W3Schools is one of the best resources for web development.
              Whenever I search for HTML tags or CSS styles, W3Schools is always
              one of the top results on Google. The documentation is very
              organized and the examples provided are one of their best
              features. I always click the try it yourself button in order mess
              around with the example. I always have W3Schools open when I am
              working on a website.

              Stack Overflow is a website where developers ask and answer
              questions. I find myself on this website very often when I Google
              my questions. There is a good chance that another developer has
              ran into the same bug as you have in the past and asked that
              question on Stack Overflow. It is a forum and the quality of the
              answers depends on the quality of the community. The voting system
              ensures that the answered deemed 'best' by the community is the
              one a future developer will see first.

              LeetCode is a website where I practice coding problems. It is a
              great way to prepare for potential interviews. The problems are
              sorted by difficulty and there are a lot of fellow developers
              eager to help you if you get stuck. The problems already have
              built in test cases so all you need to focus on is coming up with
              a solution. LeetCode supports many languages, but I personally use
              JavaScript and Java.

              offers.
